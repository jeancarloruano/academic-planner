# CSUDH Academic Planner
My senior project for Cal State Domniguez Hills.
This academic planner is designed to assist students at keeping track of their course history during their time in school.
The application was implemented using ReactJS for the front-end and Java Spring Boot for the back-end.
Developed by Jeancarlo Ruano and Anthony Bruno.
